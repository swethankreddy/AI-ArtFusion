# ArtFusion - Week 3: Building Your Neural Style Transfer Model

## Overview
In this week, you will:
- Learn about neural style transfer (NST) and how it blends the style of one image with the content of another.
- Experiment with different parameters, such as content and style weights, to understand their impact on the output image.
- Complete an assignment to analyze how these parameters affect your results.

This weekâ€™s objective is to give you hands-on experience with implementing and testing the key concepts behind neural style transfer.

## Objectives
- **Build a neural style transfer model**: Implement a model that can combine the content of one image and the style of another.
- **Experiment with parameters**: Vary the content and style weights and observe how they influence the generated image.
- **Batch processing**: Learn how to process multiple images at once using your model.
- **Parameter analysis**: Analyze and document the effects of different parameter combinations (style and content weights) on the output.

## Prerequisites
You should have a basic understanding of:
- Python programming.
- Deep learning concepts, especially neural networks.
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (you can choose which one to use).

## Requirements
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** (you may choose either)
- **PIL** (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing the outputs
- **NumPy** for mathematical operations
